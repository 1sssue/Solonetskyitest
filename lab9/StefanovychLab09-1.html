<h2 class="cl1">Grimoire: The City—Onslaught</h2>
<p><pre>
"Our enemies never relent. Neither will you." —Lord Shaxx

——————

Despite the sharp breeze in the Tower, the air in Shaxx's outpost is uncomfortably still and weighted with tension. There is work to do: personal feeling must not interfere when certain doom hangs over all their heads.

"We can't afford to play defense. Not now." Shaxx stares fixedly at the training plans drawn up for his Guardians.

"Then offense will have to see us through this fight. That should come naturally to you." Saladin's posture is Legionary-perfect.

"Then that's that." Teeth gritted under his helmet, Shaxx folds his arms. After a long moment, he adds, "Good talk."

Saladin nods. "Good talk."

They look at the screen in silence. There is nobody to rescue them.

<h2 class="cl2">Grimoire: Eris Morn—Hive God of Vengeance</h2>
<p><pre>
Eris, tenacious Eris. Crota's Bane, Oryx's Sorrow. Ruin of Xivu Arath.

To see you reduced once again to a minion of the Awoken queen. Examining a locked gate for signs of weakness. Rattling the bars to the afterlife, when you might have kicked the door in!

This very plane could have been yours.

What you lacked in natural talent you fashioned from scholarly genius. Your will is the thing, and I mistook yours. How you burned with it! The noble vindication of victory.

Every sword ever raised against you—can I say, against us? Down through the long years of history. Vengeance killed Oryx, why not his sibling?

But you threw the match. What good is a mortal blow, half-delivered? You whet your blade and threw it down. The throne of war, abandoned. A thousand, thousand races fed that glorious polyp. All that hard-won evidence. You didn't even look at it.

I could have guided you. Don't you see that?

What will you do now? Kick down their banners? Hope for vengeance without bloodshed? And through what realms have you stamped the proof of your cause?

…I, too, avenged? Why would I want that?

Wait. Come back.

<h2 class="cl3">Grimoire: The Ironwood Tree</h2>
<p><pre>
"Not much sense memorializing anybody during the Dark Age. Anyone worth remembering, you'd hang onto them without trying."

Drifter crouches down in front of the Ironwood tree, mindful of the offerings littering the ground. The amulet's nothing fancy—not one of those Iron Lord tokens—but handmade, and with some care. Joxer's name is easy to read. Crisp lettering.

"Dumb heroics will get you every time. Volunteering. First one through, so the rest of us know not to try it." Drifter smirks. "He'd have had a fighting chance against a Primeval. Big payout if he made it. Cleaner death if he didn't."

Lord Shaxx shifts his weight. His helmet cants toward the Drifter.

"But then you wouldn't be standing there."

There's no reply.
